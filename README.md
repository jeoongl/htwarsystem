# htwarsystem - Tourism Website and Reservation System

Htwarsystem is a web-based tourism and reservation platform designed to connect tourists with local tourism businesses. The system provides user-friendly interfaces for tourists, business owners, and administrators to manage bookings, promote destinations, and streamline tourism operations.

This project was developed as part of the capstone requirement for the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology program at Southern Leyte State University – Hinunangan Campus, for the graduating class of 2025. It is the culmination of the skills, knowledge, and experiences we have acquired throughout our academic journey. The system was specifically intended for the Municipal Tourism Office of Hinunangan, Southern Leyte, aiming to provide digital solutions that support local tourism efforts, streamline information management, and enhance public access to tourism-related content and services.

Our team was composed of five dedicated members, each contributing their unique strengths to ensure the project’s success. I had the honor of serving as the project manager, responsible for coordinating our tasks, guiding the development process, and maintaining the overall direction of the project. Additionally, I took the lead role in the development and programming aspects, designing and building the core structure of the system, writing the majority of the code, and ensuring that our technical implementation aligned with our goals.
